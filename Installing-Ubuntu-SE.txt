To be able to use the Standard Editions (SE) tools on Win10, you must install Ubuntu on Windows. You'll need an up-to-date copy of Windows 10 (Fall Creators Update or later) to do it this way; the steps for an earlier version of Win10 are more involved.

To do so, install Windows Subsytem for Linux (WSL), which is a Windows Feature, by turning in on in Windows Features (Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Programs and Features\Turn Windows Features on or off; select Windows Subsytem for Linux) and sitting through a reboot (it's the only one you'll have to sit through).

Install Ubuntu by going to the Windows Store, finding and installing Ubuntu, and running it, and waiting for it to initialize in a terminal window (take a few minutes). You'll be prompted for a userId and password.

(If you have to start over, you can Remove Ubuntu via Win10 Add/Remove and start again at the beginning of this document. If you're like me, you'll have to do it a few times ;-)

Once Ubuntu is finished initializing, you should be staring at a terminal window. The rest of these steps are typed at the command prompt. You can copy them from here and paste (by right-clicking in the terminal window!).

Note that the following is essentially following the instructions in https://standardebooks.org/contribute/producing-an-ebook-step-by-step/ and the README.md it references. The readme file is located in the tools directory after we clone the tools repo.

1: paste the following line into the terminal window and hit enter:

git clone https://github.com/standardebooks/tools.git

        => now we have the README.md referred to in producing-an-ebook-step-by-step. To view it using a Windows tool like Notepad, open:
        [winDrive]\Users\[userId]\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_[uniqueId]\LocalState\rootfs\home\[userId]\tools\README.md

        => THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT: ***you can read a file that's in rootfs with a Win10 tool, but NEVER write to (or change) any rootfs file with a Win10 tool***

        => basically, unless you're in a Ubuntu terminal window, like now, or accessing a terminal from within Visual Studio Code (more on that later), you can't change anything!

2: the next line requires execution with elevated privileges, so you use the sudo program to run it (sudo is "super user do"). You'll be prompted for your sudo password, which is the one you picked when Ubuntu initialized. You won't be prompted for it again in this Ubuntu session.

sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools

3: the next line updates packages already installed.

sudo apt-get update

4: install dependencies -- this will take about an hour to run

sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev libxml2-utils librsvg2-bin libimage-exiftool-perl imagemagick epubcheck default-jre inkscape calibre curl git

5: install required fonts -- these lines can be all pasted into the terminal window together

mkdir -p ~/.fonts/
curl -s -o ~/.fonts/LeagueSpartan-Bold.otf "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theleagueof/league-spartan/master/LeagueSpartan-Bold.otf"
curl -s -o ~/.fonts/OFLGoudyStM.otf "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theleagueof/sorts-mill-goudy/master/OFLGoudyStM.otf"
curl -s -o ~/.fonts/OFLGoudyStM-Italic.otf "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theleagueof/sorts-mill-goudy/master/OFLGoudyStM-Italic.otf"

6: rebuild the local font cache

sudo fc-cache -fv

7: install python-dev and dependencies

sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev

8: install python dependencies

pip3 install -r ./tools/requirements.txt
sudo apt-get update

9: install hyphenation dictionaries for the pyhyphen library

python3 -c "exec(\"from hyphen import dictools\\ndictools.install('en_GB')\\ndictools.install('en_US')\")"

10: install python pip and git

sudo apt install python-pip
sudo -H pip install gitpython

11: at this point we follow steps 2 and 3 in https://standardebooks.org/contribute/producing-an-ebook-step-by-step

12: for step 4, we diverge. We're going to create a "home" directory in the Windows filesystem in which to store our SE data.

I suggest a folder called GitHub. I use C:\Users\brian\Documents\GitHub.

Having created that folder, we return to the terminal prompt and set our working directory to our new "home" by mounting the Windows folder.

cd /mnt/c/Users/brian/Documents/GitHub

From now one, whenever we see "user@localhost>" in the SE documentation, we'll use this folder instead.

So step 4a. in producing-an-ebook-step-by-step becomes:

~/tools/create-draft --author="Robert Louis Stevenson" --title="The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" --gutenberg-ebook-url="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/43"
